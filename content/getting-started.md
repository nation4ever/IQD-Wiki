# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with the wiki.

## Creating Pages

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `content/` directory
2. Add frontmatter at the top of the file:

```markdown
---
title: My Page Title
description: A brief description
---
```

3. Write your content using Markdown

## Nested Pages

Create folders to organize your content:

- `content/topic/page.md` → `/topic/page`
- `content/topic/index.md` → `/topic`
