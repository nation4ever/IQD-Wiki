# Welcome to the Wiki

This is your markdown-based wiki. Create new pages by adding `.md` files to the `content/` directory.

## Getting Started

- Create markdown files in the `content/` folder
- The file path becomes the URL (e.g., `content/guide/intro.md` → `/guide/intro`)
- Use frontmatter for page metadata (title, description)

## Example Structure

```
content/
├── index.md          → /
├── getting-started.md → /getting-started
└── guide/
    ├── index.md      → /guide
    └── installation.md → /guide/installation
```
